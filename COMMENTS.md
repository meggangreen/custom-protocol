This program is written in Python 3.6 and can be run from the command line, e.g.:
```
python3 proto.py
```

Note: The log file 'txnlog.dat' needs to be in the same directory as the program file.

Please know that I first saw this challenge when I applied to Ad Hoc four years ago. I remembered this homework well as understanding how to read and parse the bytes was quite challenging (and fun) for me at the time. This time around, I refactored my original code and was able to make some significant improvments. For the record, four years ago I was also asked to complete SLCSP and HHBuilder. Although they can both be found in my online repositories, I have *not* updated them in any way for years.

I understand the instructions say not to include tests, but I do really rely on doctests or assert statements as I develop and I did not remove them from the file. You can see I *did* remove the program calls to *run* the doctests, however.
