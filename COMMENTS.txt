This program is written in Python 3.6 and should be run from the command line.
The log file 'txnlog.dat' needs to be in the same directory as the program file.

In an interactive Python intepreter, call "answer_adhoc_questions()" to view the
answers to the homework questions. Call "print_log('txnlog.dat'[, num])" to see
a specified number of records (15 by default) from the transaction log.
