This program is written in Python 3.6 and should be run from the command line.
The log file 'txnlog.dat' needs to be in the same directory as the program file.

In an interactive Python intepreter, call "answer_adhoc_questions()" to view the
answers to the homework questions. Call "print_log('txnlog.dat'[, num])" to see
a specified number of records (15 by default) from the transaction log.

Note: The way Python displays bytes to the programmer and the way struct.unpack
works were difficult for me to wrap my head around. I found it imperative to
examine the exact hex numbers in order to understand struct. To do that I asked
a senior engineer for help. Their assistance definitely was key to my success.
